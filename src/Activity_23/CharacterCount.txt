main method(String...args){
    calls characterCount method();
}

public static int characterCount(String s, char character you want to track){
    checks if its done going through the loop{
        return 0 to break the recursive loop;
    }
    checks if the first character in the string is equal to the char you're tracking{
        return 1 + characterCount(make sure to remove hte first character before you continue iterating,same character as before);
    }else{
        return characterCount(make sure to remove the first character even though it's not equal,same character);
    }
}

the time complexity of this program is, like with the palindromes, the same as the length of hte string you are parsing through.
