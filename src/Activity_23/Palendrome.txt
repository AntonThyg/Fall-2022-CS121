main method{
    calls the palendrome method with true and false examples.
}
palendrome method(string parameter){
    checks if there is 1 or fewer letters remaining{
        return true;
    }
    checks if first letter is equal to last letter{
        returns palendrome(removes first and last letter in this call);
    }else{
        returns false;
    }
}

The time complexity of this palendrome solver would be the same as the length of the palendrome/string you are checking
because the direct.
